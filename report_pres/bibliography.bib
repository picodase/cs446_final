	abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool ({BLAST}), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair ({MSP}) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of {MSP} scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward {DNA} and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long {DNA} sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, {BLAST} is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

The resource provides two levels of release: {CATH}-B, a daily snapshot of the latest structural domain boundaries and superfamily assignments, and {CATH}+, which adds layers of derived data, such as predicted sequence domains, functional annotations and functional clustering (known as Functional Families or {FunFams}). The most recent {CATH}+ release (version 4.2) provides a huge update in the coverage of structural data. This release increases the number of fully-classified domains by over 40\% (from 308 999 to 434 857 structural domains), corresponding to an almost two-fold increase in sequence data (from 53 million to over 95 million predicted domains) organised into 6119 superfamilies. The coverage of high-resolution, protein {PDB} chains that contain at least one assigned {CATH} domain is now 90.2\% (increased from 82.3\% in the previous release). A number of highly requested features have also been implemented in our web pages: Allowing the user to view an alignment between their query sequence and a representative {FunFam} structure and providing tools that make it easier to view the full structural context (multi-domain architecture) of domains and chains.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The need for efficient molecular docking tools for high-throughput screening is growing alongside the rapid growth of drug-fragment databases. {AutoDock} Vina ('Vina') is a widely used docking tool with parallelization for speed. {QuickVina} ('{QVina} 1') then further enhanced the speed via a heuristics, requiring high exhaustiveness. With low exhaustiveness, its accuracy was compromised. We present in this article the latest version of {QuickVina} ('{QVina} 2') that inherits both the speed of {QVina} 1 and the reliability of the original Vina. Results: We tested the efficacy of {QVina} 2 on the core set of {PDBbind} 2014. With the default exhaustiveness level of Vina (i.e. 8), a maximum of 20.49-fold and an average of 2.30-fold acceleration with a correlation coefficient of 0.967 for the first mode and 0.911 for the sum of all modes were attained over the original Vina. A tendency for higher acceleration with increased number of rotatable bonds as the design variables was observed. On the accuracy, Vina wins over {QVina} 2 on 30\% of the data with average energy difference of only 0.58∈kcal/mol. On the same dataset, {GOLD} produced {RMSD} smaller than 2∈{\textbackslash}{AA} on 56.9\% of the data while {QVina} 2 attained 63.1\%. Availability and implementation: The C++ source code of {QVina} 2 is available at (www.qvina.org).},

	abstract = {Globular proteins typically fold into tightly packed arrays of regular secondary structures. We developed a model to approximate the compact parallel and antiparallel arrangement of α-helices and β-strands, enumerated all possible topologies formed by up to five secondary structural elements ({SSEs}), searched for their occurrence in spatial structures of proteins, and documented their frequencies of occurrence in the {PDB}. The enumeration model grows larger super-secondary structure patterns ({SSPs}) by combining pairs of smaller patterns, a process that approximates a potential path of protein fold evolution. The most prevalent {SSPs} are typically present in superfolds such as the Rossmann-like fold, the ferredoxin-like fold, and the Greek key motif, whereas the less frequent {SSPs} often possess uncommon structure features such as split β-sheets, left-handed connections, and crossing loops. This complete {SSP} enumeration model, for the first time, allows us to investigate which theoretically possible {SSPs} are not observed in available protein structures. All {SSPs} with up to four {SSEs} occurred in proteins. However, among the {SSPs} with five {SSEs}, approximately 20\% (218) are absent from existing folds. Of these unobserved {SSPs}, 80\% contain two or more uncommon structure features. To facilitate future efforts in protein structure classification, engineering, and design, we provide the resulting patterns and their frequency of occurrence in proteins at: http://prodata.swmed.edu/ssps/.},

Our {GCN} predicts functions more accurately than Convolutional Neural Networks trained on sequence data alone and competing methods. Feature extraction via a language model removes the need for constructing multiple sequence alignments or feature engineering. Our model learns general structure-function relationships by robustly predicting functions of proteins with ≤ 30\% sequence identity to the training set. Using class activation mapping, we can automatically identify structural regions at the residue-level that lead to each function prediction for every protein confidently predicted, advancing site-specific function prediction. De-noising inherent in the trained model allows an only minor drop in performance when structure predictions are used, including multiple de novo protocols. We use our method to annotate all proteins in the {PDB}, making several new confident function predictions spanning both fold and function trees.},

	abstract = {The ribosome is a highly dynamic machine responsible for protein synthesis within the cell. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-{EM}) and X-ray crystallography structures of ribosomal particles, alone and in complex with diverse ligands (protein factors, {RNAs} and small molecules), have revealed the dynamic nature of the ribosome and provided much needed insight into translation and its regulation. In the past years, there has been exponential growth in the deposition of cryo-{EM} maps into the Electron Microscopy Data Bank ({EMDB}) as well as atomic structures into the Protein Data Bank ({PDB}). Unfortunately, the deposited ribosomal particles usually have distinct orientations with respect to one another, which complicate the comparison of the available structures. To simplify this, we have developed a Database of Aligned Ribosomal Complexes, the {DARC} site (http://darcsite.genzentrum.lmu.de/darc/), which houses the available cryo-{EM} maps and atomic coordinates of ribosomal particles from the {EMDB} and {PDB} aligned within a common coordinate system. An easy-to-use, searchable interface allows users to access and download {\textbackslash}textgreater130 cryo-{EM} maps and {\textbackslash}textgreater300 atomic models in the format of brix and pdb files, respectively. The aligned coordinate system substantially simplifies direct visualization of conformational changes in the ribosome, such as subunit rotation and head-swiveling, as well as direct comparison of bound ligands, such as antibiotics or translation factors.},

	title = {Sequence-based Prediction of Metamorphic Behavior in Proteins},
	doi = {10.1101/2020.02.27.967935},
	abstract = {An increasing number of proteins have been demonstrated in recent years to adopt multiple three-dimensional folds with different functions. These metamorphic proteins are characterized by having two or more folds with significant differences in their secondary structure, where each fold is stabilized by a distinct local environment. So far, about 90 metamorphic proteins have been identified in the Protein Databank ({PDB}), but we and others hypothesize that a far greater number of metamorphic proteins remain undiscovered. In this work, we introduce a computational model to predict metamorphic behavior in proteins using only knowledge of the sequence. In this model, secondary structure prediction programs are used to calculate diversity indices , which are measures of uncertainty in predicted secondary structure at each position in the sequence; these are then used to assign protein sequences as likely to be metamorphic vs. monomorphic (i.e. having just one-fold). We constructed a reference dataset to train our classification method, which includes a novel compilation of 140 likely-monomorphic proteins, and a set of 201 metamorphic proteins taken from the literature. Our model is able to classify proteins as metamorphic vs. monomorphic with a Matthews correlation coefficient of ∼0.4 and true positive / true negative rates of ∼65\% / 80\%, suggesting that it is possible to predict metamorphic behavior in proteins using only sequence information. Statement of Significance This paper introduces the diversity index as a descriptor to distinguish metamorphic proteins, which possess multiple stable folds, from monomorphic proteins that possess only one fold. The diversity index is designed to measure uncertainty in computationally predicted secondary structure, which we hypothesize is elevated for metamorphic proteins. We tested our hypothesis by training a binary classifier using the diversity index and an annotated dataset of metamorphic and monomorphic proteins, and found an optimal Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.4, supporting the hypothesis and demonstrating for the first time that it is possible to predict metamorphic behavior in proteins using only sequence information. The sequence-based classifier has broader applicability compared to methods that rely on making comparison to experimentally measured structures.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new representation and feature extraction method for biological sequences. Named bio-vectors ({BioVec}) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors ({ProtVec}) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors ({GeneVec}) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93\%+-0.06\% is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we use {ProtVec} representation to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the {DisProt} database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats ({FG}-Nups). Using support vector machine classifiers, {FG}-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank ({PDB}) with a 99.8\% accuracy, and unstructured {DisProt} sequences are differentiated from structured {DisProt} sequences with 100.0\% accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about protein structure can be determined.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10603},
	abstract = {Empirical scoring functions based on either molecular force fields or cheminformatics descriptors are widely used, in conjunction with molecular docking, during the early stages of drug discovery to predict potency and binding affinity of a drug-like molecule to a given target. These models require expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded as hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model to select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general 3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical interactions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application to structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural network is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with the complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding pose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the protein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the interaction strength associated with these features. We test our model by predicting the binding free energy of a subset of protein-ligand complexes found in the {PDBBind} dataset and compare with state-of-the-art cheminformatics and machine learning-based approaches. We find that all methods achieve experimental accuracy and that atomic convolutional networks either outperform or perform competitively with the cheminformatics based methods. Unlike all previous protein-ligand prediction systems, atomic convolutional networks are end-to-end and fully-differentiable. They represent a new data-driven, physics-based deep learning model paradigm that offers a strong foundation for future improvements in structure-based bioactivity prediction.},
